    Shiva's dance with the damaru led to the universe's creation. 
    It is believed to have produced the first sound, "nada," from the void. The damaru is linked to Nataraja's dance 
    and is said to have inspired Lord Ganesha to create music and the Vedas.
    Symbolizing Jiva, the damaru moves by Shiva's will. Its triangles signify mind and body, 
    while its chord represents the cycle of birth and death.`,
